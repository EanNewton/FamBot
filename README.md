## !help <a name = "!help"></a>
Displays a list of available commands and a brief description of what they do.

## !config <a name = "!config"></a>
Generates a config file in JSON format. Only usable by the server owner and roles designated as server administrators. Simply edit the file as you desire and then drag and drop it back into any channel in your discord to apply the changes. 

Optional parameters are: 
+ !config reset --- return to a default configuration

**Example Config File**
```
{
    "Server ID": 012340123401234,
    "Server Name": "My First Server",
    "Server Locale": "Asia/Tokyo",
    "Schedule": "Monday = 10; Tuesday = 10; Wednesday = 16; Friday = 10; Saturday = 16; ",
    "URL Footer": "Come hang with us at: <https://www.twitch.tv/>",
    "Quote Format": "{0}\n ---{1} on {2}",
    "Quote Added Format": "Added:\n \"{0}\"\n by {1} on {2}",
    "Lore Format": "{0}\n ---Scribed by the Lore Master {1}, on the blessed day of {2}",
    "Blacklisted Words": "none, one, two foo bar; three",
    "Moderator Roles": "mod;admin;discord mod;\n"
}


To edit your server configuration simply change the appropiate values, and drag and drop it back into Discord to upload. 

You can always use `!config reset` to return to default values.

Server Locale: This is your default timezone location. 
    See "!schedule help" for more locations.
    
Schedule: This is your stream schedule, times are in 24 hour format. 
    The format to add a stream is:
        [DAY] = [TIME 1], [TIME 2];
        Monday = 10:30, 14; Wednesday = 18; Friday = 12:15, 14:30
    This would add scheduled times for Monday at 10:30AM and 2:00PM, Wednesday at 6PM, etc.

URL Footer: A brief message to be displayed beneath the schedule.
        
Quote Format: How quotes should be displayed when a user enters "!quote". 
    To create a line break use \n.
    {0} will be the quote text.
    {1} will be the quote's author.
    {2} will be the date.
    Each {} field may only be used once.
    
Lore Format: How lore should be displayed when a user enters "!lore". 
    Lore works the same as quotes but only admins and mods may add to it. 
    This is useful for stream point redeems. 
    See "!lore help" for more information.
    
Quote Added Format: What is displayed when a user reacts with :speech_left: to add a new quote. 
    It also follows the {} order of text, author, date.
```

## !sched <a name = "!sched"></a>
Display a schedule of upcoming events for the server in the user's own time zone. Any events occurring today will be bolded.

Aliased names for the command are:
+ !s
+ !sched
+ !schedule

Optional parameters are:
+ !sched help --- display more detailed options available to the user
+ !sched help [CONTINENT] --- display a list of cities in that continent that users can set their location to. Continents include: Africa, America, Antarctica, Asia, Atlantic, Australia, Europe, Indian, Pacific, and abbr. Note: "abbr" is a short list of common locations that have been aliased, e.g. pst, est, jst, gmt
+ !sched set [CONTINENT]/[CITY] --- sets the user's timezone to the correct one for that location
+ !sched [CONTINENT]/[CITY] --- see the schedule for that location without changing the user's location
+ !sched override [USER ID] [USER NAME] [CONTINENT]/[CITY] --- an administrator only command to change any user's location

## !quote <a name = "!quote"></a>
Users can react to any message in the discord with the :speech_left: reaction to add it to a list of quotes. 
Quotes may be any message that is not from a bot, including text, images, videos, embeds, or files.
A random quote can then be displayed by using the !quote command.
Administrators can use :x: on a message that has a received a :speech_left: to remove it from the quotes list. Multiple users reacting with :speech_left: will not add the quote multiple times.
  
Aliased names for the command are:
+ !q
+ !quote

Optional parameters are:
+ !quote [USER] --- Display a quote that was said by that specific user. Note that this is their actual username (case sensitive) and not their display nickname so as to prevent confusion as users change nicknames often. If you are unsure click on the user in either the right panel users list or on their profile picture next to any message they've sent to see their actual username. This does not include the discriminator, which is a # sign folowed by four numbers.
+ !quote help --- Display a brief explanation of the command usage available to the user.


## !lore <a name = "!lore"></a>
  Works almost exactly the same as !quote but new entries can only be added by administrators, a sort of VIP version of !quote or a randomized version of a pinned message.
  
  Aliased names for the command are:
  + !l
  + !lore
  
  Optional parameters are:
  + !lore help --- Display a brief explanation of the command usage available to the user.
  + !lore [USER] --- Display a piece of lore from a specific user.
  + !lore add [USER] [TEXT] --- Add a new lore entry of [TEXT] with the author set as [USER] at the current date and time. Note that the [USER] must be a single word, any text after the first whitespace will be part of [TEXT]. Administrators may add a :x: reaction to the "!lore add" message to remove the entry.
  
## !dict <a name = "!dict"></a>
Returns the English Wiktionary entry for a word or phrase. This does not necessarily need to be an English word, it simply needs to have an entry in the https://en.wiktionary.org site.

Aliased names for the command are:
+ !dict
+ !dictionary

Optional parameters are:
+ !dict [TEXT] --- Display an explanation of any single word or phrase.

origami
PRONUNCIATION:
(or-i-GAH-mee)
MEANING:
noun:
1. The art of folding paper into various shapes.
2. An object made by folding paper.
ETYMOLOGY:
 From Japanese origami, from ori (fold) + kami (paper). Earliest
documented use: 1948.
NOTES:
Origami is not just folding paper cranes. Aliaksei Zholner has built a
working V8 engine with just paper and gray matter: video (3 min.). I bow in his general direction. Origami has practical
applications too. For example, in a folding airbag in a car to a solar-panel
array on a satellite.
USAGE:
‚ÄúBut tasting exposes origami folds of scents and flavors.‚Äù
Andrew Ross; At The Garrison, ‚ÄòThoughtful‚Äô Food You Won‚Äôt Soon Forget;
Portland Press Herald (Maine); Nov 10, 2019.
‚ÄúA toothy man in dungarees grinned back at me. Slim sort, with a face
creased in a thousand places, like an unfolded bit of origami.‚Äù
Dot Gumbi; The Pirates of Maryland Point; 2016.

# Info for Geeks <a name = "geeky"></a>

This project is written entirely in Python 3 as a passion project, as well as my first project in Python. You are encouraged to use, modify, fork, contribute, hack, or do whatever your heart desires with it within the confines of the GNU General Public License Version 3. Pull requests are warmly welcomed.

The core design philosophies for the bot are that it should be: easy to use, easy to maintain and modify, and reliable. Python may not always have the comparable speed of C or its compatriots but I'll be damned if it isn't beautiful.

+ [Packages](#packages)
+ [How it Works](#workings)

## Packages <a name = "packages"></a>
The backend makes heavy use of SQLite 3 via the SQLAlchemy project.

The full list of external Python packages directly imported is:
+ [Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/)
+ [Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/)
+ [DotEnv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)
+ [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
+ [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/)
+ [AIOFiles](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles)
+ [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
+ [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
+ [word_cloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud)
+ [PyPlot](https://matplotlib.org/)
+ [SciKit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
+ [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)


## How it Works <a name = "workings"></a>

The general top-level work flow of the bot is very straight forward. It first loads its API tokens for Discord and Wolfram from the local .env file, creates generic connections to the local SQLite database, sets up a local .log file to keep track of any errors, and then connects to the Discord interface.

It then watches for a handful of events: 
+ [being invited to a new guild](#join)
+ [a reaction being added to a message](#reaction)
+ [an error](#errors)
+ [or a message being sent](#messages)

### On Joining a Guild <a name = "join"></a>

When the bot joins a guild for the first time we want to hit that first design philosophy and Make Things Easy. So, we send a title image and a welcome message.

There are several events that occur frequently with slight variations, e.g. reading from a file or checking if a user is an administrator. For these common tasks I have created the `tutil.py` file. 

Here we will encounter the call to fetchFile() in tutil.py for the first time of many. This function looks into our ./docs/ directory for given file in a given directory and simply returns it to be used in our banner. Any time the bot will be displaying content to the end users I refer to it as a banner. I implemented it this way as part of the second core philosophy, Easy to Modify, so that these common messages can be changed on the fly without needing to interrupt service to users by stopping and reloading the entire bot to change internal code. 

```
@bot.event
async def on_guild_join(guild):
	banner = 'Hello {}! \n{}'.format(guild.owner.mention, fetchFile('help', 'welcome'))
	await guild.system_channel.send(banner, file=discord.File('./docs/header.png'))
```
--->
```
def fetchFile(directory, filename):
	with open('{}/docs/{}/{}.txt'.format(DEFAULT_DIR, directory, filename), 'r') as f:
		return f.read()
```

This message is sent to the guild's system_channel (by default the first text channel created, though in practice it is often changed by users to a hidden admin channel) and prompts the server owner through basic config setup for the bot.

### On Reactions Added <a name = "reaction"></a>
