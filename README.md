# About <a name = "about"></a>

I initially created this bot to address a problem I saw occurring frequently: Twitch was helping to connect people from all over the globe, which is a wonderful thing, but it brought the problem of communicating across all those disparate places. A streamer would say something like, "Hey friends! I'll be streaming every Tuesday at 6:00PM!" but when exactly that 6:00PM on Tuesday actually is would be different for people located in London vs New York vs Melbourne. I wanted a simple and intuitive way for anyone to find out when it would occur for them with a single command. 

The project has been growing and adding features as requested since then. If there's a change you'd like to see feel free to issue a Pull Request or contact me.

Invite the bot to your server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=663696399862595584&permissions=8&scope=bot

Or, clone the the project to a local directory and launch it with:
`python3 main.py`
You will need a bot token from the Discord Developer portal as well as one from Wolfram, placed into ./.env

## !help <a name = "!help"></a>

Displays a list of available commands and a brief description of what they do.

**Examples**

![help example](https://github.com/EanNewton/FamBot/blob/master/Samples/help.png)

## !config <a name = "!config"></a>

Generates a config file in JSON format. Only usable by the server owner and roles designated as server administrators. Simply edit the file as you desire and then drag and drop it back into any channel in your discord to apply the changes. 

Optional parameters are: 

+ !config reset --- return to a default configuration

**Example Config File**

```
{
    "Server ID": 012340123401234,
    "Server Name": "My First Server",
    "Server Locale": "Asia/Tokyo",
    "Schedule": "Monday = 10; Tuesday = 10; Wednesday = 16; Friday = 10; Saturday = 16; ",
    "URL Footer": "Come hang with us at: <https://www.twitch.tv/>",
    "Quote Format": "{0}\n ---{1} on {2}",
    "Quote Added Format": "\"{0}\"\n by {1} on {2}",
    "Lore Format": "{0}\n ---Scribed by the Lore Master {1}, on the blessed day of {2}",
    "Blacklisted Words": "none, one, two foo bar; three",
    "Moderator Roles": "mod;admin;discord mod;\n"
}


To edit your server configuration simply change the appropiate values, and drag and drop it back into Discord to upload. 

You can always use `!config reset` to return to default values.

Server Locale: This is your default timezone location. 
    See "!schedule help" for more locations.
    
Schedule: This is your stream schedule, times are in 24 hour format. 
    The format to add a stream is:
        [DAY] = [TIME 1], [TIME 2];
        Monday = 10:30, 14; Wednesday = 18; Friday = 12:15, 14:30
    This would add scheduled times for Monday at 10:30AM and 2:00PM, Wednesday at 6PM, etc.

URL Footer: A brief message to be displayed beneath the schedule.
        
Quote Format: How quotes should be displayed when a user enters "!quote". 
    To create a line break use \n.
    {0} will be the quote text.
    {1} will be the quote's author.
    {2} will be the date.
    Each {} field may only be used once.
    
Lore Format: How lore should be displayed when a user enters "!lore". 
    Lore works the same as quotes but only admins and mods may add to it. 
    This is useful for stream point redeems. 
    See "!lore help" for more information.
    
Quote Added Format: What is displayed when a user reacts with :speech_left: to add a new quote. 
    It also follows the {} order of text, author, date.
```

## !log <a name = "!log"></a>

Admin command to get a log of all messages sent in the guild in Excel format.
Note: This will be sent to the channel the command was used in and therefore available to any users who can see the channel.

## !sched <a name = "!sched"></a>

Display a schedule of upcoming events for the server in the user's own time zone. Any events occurring today will be bolded.

Aliased names for the command are:

+ !s
+ !sched
+ !schedule

Optional parameters are:

+ !sched help --- display more detailed options available to the user
+ !sched help [CONTINENT] --- display a list of cities in that continent that users can set their location to. Continents include: Africa, America, Antarctica, Asia, Atlantic, Australia, Europe, Indian, Pacific, and abbr. Note: "abbr" is a short list of common locations that have been aliased, e.g. pst, est, jst, gmt
+ !sched set [CONTINENT]/[CITY] --- sets the user's timezone to the correct one for that location
+ !sched [CONTINENT]/[CITY] --- see the schedule for that location without changing the user's location
+ !sched override [CONTINENT]/[CITY] @User1 @User2 @User3... --- an administrator only command to change any user's location

**Examples**

![sched exmaple](https://github.com/EanNewton/FamBot/blob/master/Samples/sched.png)

## !quote <a name = "!quote"></a>

Users can react to any message in the discord with the :speech_left: reaction to add it to a list of quotes. 
Quotes may be any message that is not from a bot, including text, images, videos, embeds, or files.
A random quote can then be displayed by using the !quote command.
Administrators can use :x: on a message that has a received a :speech_left: to remove it from the quotes list. Multiple users reacting with :speech_left: will not add the quote multiple times.

Aliased names for the command are:

+ !q
+ !quote

Optional parameters are:

+ !quote [USER] --- Display a quote that was said by that specific user. You can either use @user or their username format. Note that this is their actual username (case sensitive) and not their display nickname so as to prevent confusion as users change nicknames often. If you are unsure click on the user in either the right panel users list or on their profile picture next to any message they've sent to see their actual username. This does not include the discriminator, which is a # sign folowed by four numbers.
+ !quote [ID] --- Display a specific quote by its ID number.
+ !quote help --- Display a brief explanation of the command usage available to the user.
+ !quote log --- Admin command to return a log of all saved quotes in Excel format. Note: This is posted to the channel the command is used in and therefore available to any users who can view that channel.
+ !quote delete [ID] --- Admin command to remove a quote by its ID number.

**Examples**

![quote example](https://github.com/EanNewton/FamBot/blob/master/Samples/quote.png)

## !lore <a name = "!lore"></a>

  Works almost exactly the same as !quote but new entries can only be added by administrators, a sort of VIP version of !quote or a randomized version of a pinned message.

  Aliased names for the command are:

  + !l
  + !lore

  Optional parameters are:

  + !lore help --- Display a brief explanation of the command usage available to the user.

  + !lore add [USER] [TEXT] --- Add a new lore entry of [TEXT] with the author set as [USER] at the current date and time. Note that the [USER] must be a single word, any text after the first whitespace will be part of [TEXT]. Administrators may add a :x: reaction to the "!lore add" message to remove the entry.

## !dict <a name = "!dict"></a>

Returns the English Wiktionary entry for a word or phrase. This does not necessarily need to be an English word, it simply needs to have an entry in the https://en.wiktionary.org site. Due to Discord's character limit for Embed objects, words with very long entries may not return anything.

+ !dict
+ !dictionary
+ !wiki
+ !wiktionary

Optional parameters are:

+ !dict [TEXT] --- Display an explanation of any single word or phrase.

Display some fun info about the messages being sent. The default command will generate a word cloud of the most common words for the server.

Optional parameters are:

+ !stats help --- Show the help interface.
+ !stats user [USERNAME] --- Create a word cloud for the specified user. Like !quote this is the case sensitive version of the username without the discriminator.
+ !stats channel [CHANNEL] --- Create a word cloud for the specified channel. This is provided as the #channel-name tag.
+ !stats count [LOW] [HIGH] --- Create a bar graph showing the number of messages of length between LOW and HIGH.
+ !stats phrases [LOW] [HIGH] [LIMIT] --- Create a graph showing the most common phrases / n-grams of length between LOW and HIGH. LIMIT is the amount of n-grams to display.

## !custom <a name = "!custom"></a>

Add custom commands to your discord.
Admins can react to any message with :gear: to add a new command. The first word of the message will be the command name, the remainder will be what is displayed. The command name is taken literally so if you want a ! or . or any prefix make sure to include that.
Admins can react to any message :X: to remove a command where the first word matches a command name to remove it.
Custom commands can override built-in commands, so if you want to disable any command -- such as !sched or !quote -- simply set up a custom command with the same name.

Custom commands can be nested and can also contain specific additional parameters.
For example, if you add the command `!custom1 Foo` and then add `!custom2 <custom1> Bar <GUILD>`, calling !custom2 will then display `Foo Bar my server`. Make sure that nested command calls are enclosed in `<>`. Custom commands do not suppress user, channel, or role mentions and will ping people if you include a mention in them.

Use `!custom` to display the help text as well as any custom commands you have setup for your server.

Additional Parameters include:

+ `<URL>` --- The URL from your from your !config file
+ `<NOW>` or `<TIME>` ---  The current time for the server location from your !config file
+ `<LOCALE>` or `<LOCATION>` --- The server locale from your !config file
+ `<AUTHOR>` --- The username of whoever used the command
+ `<GUILD>` --- Your Discord guild name
+ `<SCHED>` --- Calls !sched
+ `<QUOTE>` --- Calls !quote
+ `<LORE>` --- Calls !lore
