horse sense


PRONUNCIATION:

(HORS sens)


MEANING:

noun: Common sense.

ETYMOLOGY:

 From horse, from Old English hors + sense, from Latin sensus (faculty of
feeling). Earliest documented use: 1832.

NOTES:

Why horses in this idiom, as opposed to, say, foxes? Perhaps it’s
the association of horses with the country and the sound practical judgment
shown by an unsophisticated country person. Or maybe it’s an allusion to a
horse’s sense in staying out of trouble. Also, in Jonathan Swift’s 1726
satire Gulliver’s Travels, Houyhnhnms is a race of horses endowed with
reason, contrasted with Yahoos (boorish humans). Compare the term horsefeathers (nonsense).

USAGE:

“‘There’s so much more to it than that, just dealing with personalities
in the room, reading the room, conversations, and then just good,
old-fashioned horse sense.’”
Bruce Miles; Maddon Wants More for Established Managers; Daily Herald
