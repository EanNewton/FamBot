Add custom text commands to your server!

Admins can react to any message with :gear: to add a new command.
The first word of the message will be the command name, the remainder will be what is displayed.
This is taken literally so if you want a ! or . or any other prefix make sure to include it.
Admins can react to any message with :X: to remove a command where the first word matches a command name to remove it.
Custom commands can override built-in commands, so if you want something like `!quote` to be disabled in the server you can set it up as a custom command.

Custom commands can be nested and can also contain specific additional parameters.
For example, if you add the command `!custom1 Foo` and then add `!custom2 <!custom1> Bar`, calling `!custom2` will display `Foo Bar`. Make sure that the nested commands are enclosed in `<>`.

**Custom commands do NOT suppress user, role, or channel pings.**
