To edit your server configuration simply change the appropiate values, and drag and drop it back into Discord to upload. 

You can always use `!config reset` to return to default values.
```
Server Locale: This is your default timezone location. 
    See "!schedule help" for more locations.
    
Schedule: This is your stream schedule, times are in 24 hour format. 
    The format to add a stream is:
        [DAY] = [TIME 1], [TIME 2];
        Monday = 10:30, 14; Wednesday = 18; Friday = 12:15, 14:30
    This would add scheduled times for Monday at 10:30AM and 2:00PM, Wednesday at 6PM, etc.

URL Footer: A brief message to be displayed beneath the schedule.
        
Quote Format: How quotes should be displayed when a user enters "!quote". 
    To create a line break use \n.
    {0} will be the quote text.
    {1} will be the quote's author.
    {2} will be the date.
    
Lore Format: How lore should be displayed when a user enters "!lore". 
    Lore works the same as quotes but only admins and mods may add to it. 
    This is useful for stream point redeems. 
    See "!lore help" for more information.
    
Quote Added Format: What is displayed when a user reacts with :speech_left: to add a new quote. 
    It also follows the {} order of text, author, date.
