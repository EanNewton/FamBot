To setup or edit your server configuration simply open the attached file, change the appropiate values, and drag and drop it back into Discord to upload.

You can always use `!config reset` to return to default values.

You will find the following values:
```
id: This is your Discord server ID, do not change this.
    
guild_name: This is your Discord server name, do not change this.
    
locale: This is your default timezone location. See "!schedule help" for more locations.
    
schedule: This is your stream schedule, times are in 24 hour format. 
        The format to add a stream is:
        Monday = 10:30, 14; Wednesday = 18; Friday = 12:15, 14:30
        This would add scheduled times for Monday at 10:30AM and 2:00PM, Wednesday at 6PM, etc.
        
quote_format: How quotes should be displayed when a user enters "!quote". To create a line break use "\\n".
        The first {} will be the quote text.
        The second {} will be the quote's author.
        The third {} will be the date.
    
lore_format: How lore should be displayed when a user enters "!lore". Lore works the same as quotes but only admins and mods may add to it. This is useful for stream point redeems. See "!lore help" for more information.
    
qAdd_format: This is what will be displayed when a user reacts with :speech_left: to add a new quote. It also follows the {} order of text, author, date.
```
